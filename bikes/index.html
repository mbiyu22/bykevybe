               <P>
                Mountain bike are commonly reffered to as MTBs.
                Mountrain bikes usually comes in various types,that is cross-country,trail,Enduro and downhill.
                consider your rinding preffrences and terrain.
                Cross-country bikes are efficient on climbs,while a balance.
                Enduro bikes handle challengimg descents and downhill bikes excel on steep,technical terrain.

                <h3>Commuter Bike</h3>
                  <p>
                    A standard commuter bike AKA Dutch style bike is very upright.
                    This provide alot of stability and control on the bike and it is most common for beginners 
                    or those just looking for a gentle cruise down a smooth path.
                    There shouldn't be any kind of leaning in a bike like this.If there is any it is a sign that some 
                    adjustments are in order such as lifting the seat
                  </p>

           <div>
                 <h3>Road Bike</h3>
                      <p>
                        Riding a roadbike will have a diffrent position than a commuter bike.
                        This creates more power transfer to the pedals,which results in more efficient ride.
                        It may not feel natural to beginners and it does involve a bit of core and body strength,but 
                        there shounldn't be any pain involved.
                        it's also important to avoid relyng too much on the arms-you should be using your core to keep 
                        you in the correct position.

                    Triathlon Bike
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Triathlon Bikes are built with aerodynamis in mind and are not meant for casual riding.
                    This style of bike will put your upper boddy nearly parallel with the road in order to decrease 
                    the amount of wind resistance and optimize power.
                    It also requires a lot of core strength and some flexibility.
                    Alot of beginners think trhat leg strength is the most important ,but it really comes down to core and 
                    proper bike fit.

                <h3>
                    Why does a cyclist Bend Forward when cycling?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                    The primary reason for leaning or bending forward on the bike is to increase your overall power.
                    By leaning forward,cyclists can put more of their energy into their legs,which tanslate to greater 
                    efficiency on the bike.
                    by leaning forward,they decrease the overall surface are that us exposed to the wind,resulting
                    in less drag.
                    </li>

                    <li> 
                        Another reason for bending forward is to improve your balance and have a better center of gravity.
                        being too upright is far less stable.
                        Not only the cyclist shall be more prone to being knocked around by wind,they are also more likely
                         to loose control of the bike.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Leaning slightly forward can also help with climbing hills, but it is important to make sure you 
                        are  not leaning too far forward.If you stand up to pedal and most of your weight is over your handle
                        bars, you will have a much more difficult time getting up the hill.instead ,make sure you keep most 
                        of your weight over your saddle
                    
                    </li>
                   </ul>
                   </p>
                </div>

                   <h3>How far forward should cyclists lean on a bike?</h3>
                   <p>
                    When you see a cyclist cruising down the road,it may look like they are leaning forward-It is almost as though
                    they are bent over at the waist.But the level of the lean really depends on the bike's geometry.
